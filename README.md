# Elevate-Labs-SQL-Tasks
Repository for SQL Scripts

# **Task1**
Defining the schema and creating tables. <br>
Go through Task1.sql and execute the commands to create tables.<br>

# **Task2**
Populating the tables using "insert" . <br>
UPDATE and DELETE items of the tables with WHERE. <br>
Go through the previously created database and insert values into tables using SQL scripts in Task2.sql file.<br>

# **Task3**
Extract data from one or more tables. <br>
1.Use SELECT * and specific columns <br>
2.Apply WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN <br>
3.Sort with ORDER BY <br>
Task3.sql has all these queries for extracting data form a table. <br>

# **Task4**
Performing Aggregate functions.<br>
1.Using GROUP BY and HAVING.<br>
2.Use MIN,MAX,AVG,COUNT,SUM.<br>
3.Go through the Task4.sql, run queries in order to create a new DB, create a table and populate it with values.<br>
4.Then perform aggregate functions.<br>

# **Task5** 
This task demonstrates the use of different types of SQL joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS, and FULL OUTER via UNION) on the Customers and Orders tables.<br>  
It helps understand how to combine data across tables and handle matching/non-matching records.<br>  

# **Task6**
This task demonstrates different types of subqueries (scalar, correlated, `IN`, `EXISTS`, and `=`) using an E-commerce database with Customers, Orders, and Products tables.<br>  
The queries extract insights such as highest spending customer, orders above customer average, high-value customers, and most expensive product category.<br>

# **Task7**  
This project demonstrates the use of **SQL Views** to simplify reporting and enhance security in an e-commerce database.<br> 
**CustomerOrderSummary** provides total orders and spending per customer.<br>  
**HighValueCustomers** shows only customers with spending above â‚¹5000, ensuring controlled access to sensitive data.<br>
